# Q1_Project
Overview
	The purpose for this website is to provide golfers of all skill levels the ability to calculate their handicap index and track their progress. I also wanted to be able to link live scoring data from all PGA sanctioned golf tours for easy navigation for the user.

Instruction
	The USGA requires a minimum of 5 recorded scores before a handicap index can be calculated. Once the five scores are recorded, enter the score, slope, course rating, date, and course name in their particular boxes and hit CALCULATE. Your index is calculated and now you can continue entering scoring data and track your personl progress and the 'track you progress' button in the top left corner. 

Future Plans
	As of right right now, some features I had are still in progress such as a personalized login page, building a backend server to store the data rather than just local storage, and some other features the user can personalize for their own page.
